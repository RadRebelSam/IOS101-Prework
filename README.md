## App Brainstorming

Obsidian
Linked Notes: Obsidian allows users to link notes together with bidirectional links, creating a network of ideas that makes it easy to see how thoughts connect across different topics. This is great for knowledge building and long-term projects.
Markdown-based: All notes are stored in plain text using Markdown, which makes them easily portable, future-proof, and accessible from any text editor. It’s also easy to format content quickly without worrying about complex formatting tools.
Graph View: The visual graph that shows all linked notes is a powerful way to visualize your knowledge and explore connections between ideas. This feature turns note-taking into a highly interactive experience.

Glasp
Highlight and Save Web Content: Glasp allows users to highlight text from web articles, blogs, and PDFs directly in the browser, saving key insights for future reference. It's a quick and simple way to capture and organize online research.
Social Sharing of Highlights: Glasp has a social component where users can share their highlights with the community or view what others have highlighted on the same content. This creates a collaborative learning environment.
Seamless Sync Across Devices: The highlights and notes are automatically synced across devices, making it easy to access saved content from anywhere, whether you’re on your phone or desktop.

Pinterest
Visual Inspiration and Discovery: Pinterest allows users to discover and save visual content like images, infographics, and design ideas. It’s a great tool for getting inspiration for projects or hobbies, from home decor to fashion.
Organized Boards: Users can save pins to boards that they can organize by theme or project, making it easy to manage and categorize content in a personalized way.
Content Recommendations: Pinterest’s recommendation algorithm suggests pins based on a user’s interests and past activity, helping them discover new ideas and trends that match their tastes.

App Idea: "KnowledgeGraph"
"KnowledgeGraph" would be a personal knowledge management tool similar to Obsidian but with enhanced AI-powered suggestions for linking related notes. As users create notes, the app would automatically suggest connections to other notes based on the content, saving time and enhancing the knowledge graph. It would also allow users to customize views of their notes network, with different modes for task management, creative brainstorming, or deep research. The app could integrate with external resources (e.g., Wikipedia or academic papers) to auto-generate research links.
